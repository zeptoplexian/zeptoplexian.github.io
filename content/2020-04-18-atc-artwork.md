One of my sons asked if we could do some light art today. I didn't quite know what he was referring to, but after a little searching, I understood what he was talking about--light painting! I didn't know how easy it was to do basic light painting. We set the shutter speed on my phone to 30 seconds, got our UE Boom speaker as a paint brush (who would have guessed; my son thought of it), and jumped in. After trying a small flashlight that had too much brightness, we tried the speaker with its little LED light that had just the right brightness. We're by no means professionals at it, but we had a lot of fun!
