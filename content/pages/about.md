### Welcome to Zeptoplexian

This is a site to share anything kid-related that is uplifting, inspiring, educational, or just plain funny. The hope is to spread smiles to anyone needing a little bright spot in their day.

Zeptoplexian is a word one of my son's made up. He said it is a combination of "zeptosecond" (the smallest measure of time yet recorded) and "googolplexian" (the largest number with a name). So it's a combination of something small and something large. Kinda like kids--small, yet full of huge ideas and potential.
