Welcome to Zeptoplexian! This site's purpose is to recognize the creativity, talents, and joy of children. As a dad, my children help me see the world with a little more wonder. They give me purpose and hope. During the uncertain time of this pandemic, it felt appropriate to try and brighten people's days with life through the eyes of my children.
